# REMOTE SHUTDOWN WINDWOS PC VIA EMAIL

*NOTE : YOU MUST TURN ON LESS SECURE APPS FOR GOOGLE BEFORE USING THIS*
*Here's the link. Login with the account to be used in the script and turn on less secure apps : https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps*
This is supposed to be a open-source, light-weight, Python-based automation software/script made to automate the shutdown process.
The software/script will add itself to startup with OS (Registry Editor) and will check for mails from the registered sender(UI integration yet to be implemented) with the subject of the mail saying "Shutdown". When found, the windows machine should immediately shutdown.

The applications of this software/script can be to impose remote shutdown on your machine or on your ward's machine for several different reasons like having forgotten to shutdown the PC before leaving the house or to impose parental control.

When integrated with Google Assistant, say - "OK Google, send an email to (registered ID) with subject Shutdown". When your inbox is checked and the mail is found, you can experience automation of a satisfactoy level with such simplicity.

TO DO :-
1. Implement UI
2. Custom Check time
3. Check as soon as a mail arrives
4. Support for Linux and Mac OS
5. Make the software(.exe) version
6. Make uninstaller for the software version.
