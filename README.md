# AUTO-TEMPLATE

	ABOUT:
	I created this script to automate the generation of boiler-plates and other templates for 
	programming frameworks that I use.

	Although its exciting to create a project from the commandline, it isn't as fun when you're
	testing/going through tutorial-hell making 2-3 projects per day.

	So here's a way that will remain fun for a while.


	NOTE: This project is not 'complete' but its still functional. 
	The main idea was to make it a voice activated "software" if you may, that awaits your commands.
	This version only includes React based commmand for now. I might add a few like Laravel and Django
	soon, along with an ElectronJS wrapper.
