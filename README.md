		#Description : 
		This is just a basic, ugly version of RSA implementation using Python 3.7.
		I made this as a mini-project for my academic needs.
		Feel free to modify and re-distribute the code but do give me credits :)

A more 'polished' and 'good-looking' version is in the Electron JS repository,
made with Electron JS and Python.
CHECK IT OUT!
