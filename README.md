# Mojave Dynamic Wallpaper For Windows

Wallpapers on your Mac don’t have to look the same all day. If you’ve updated to macOS Mojave, you can set dynamic wallpapers that adapt to the time or your theme and update on their own.

I did not take the time to find each and every image so I only used 4 (1 for each quarter of the day)
This is a neat feature which can be accomplished without any code in Windows itself but I made this just for fun and for exploration purposes.

##NOTE##
Give the absolute path to the images you are using. Even if they are in the same folder as the script.
