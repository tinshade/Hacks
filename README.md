    #!ACTIVITY MONITOR FOR WINDOWS!#

    This is an activity monitor that tells you what activity is currently being performed on your windows machine.
    This is a smaller modolue of a lareger "Activity Tracker" Project that visualizes the time you have spent on 
    all your applications on a daily basis.

    This sub-module however, can be used as a spy-tool to monitor targets if used correctly.
    I have plans to make a remote tracker by extending this module in future releases

    NOTE: 
    Do not forget to install the requirements
