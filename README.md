***FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU MAY CAUSE WITH THIS.***

This is a small python script that will randomly boot the windows machine into safemode.
While a safe-mode can have 3 vairants, this one uses the basic variant that does not allow for networking or CMD
operations.
I made this as an annoyware but it is fairly simple to remove once you are in the safe-mode. If you know what you're
doing, that is.

EDIT: The EXE version is made using PyIntaller! Use this!
```
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.ico InfiniteBoot.py
```
