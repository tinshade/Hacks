	This is a malware I made to steal saved WiFi passwords from a target laptop
	and the mail the results to your EmailID. The primary function apart from stealing 
	passwords is to download a random wallpaper from Unsplash.com and set it as laptop 
	while displaying a quick notification as a toast on Windows10.

	This works only on Windows OS for now. I will be checking off the TODO list soon.

# TODO

	#1. Try to encrypt the mail.txt with a key being mailed
	#2. Hide the mail.txt upon creation
	#3. Only allow to run once per day
	#4. Identify the OS
	#5. Identidy if the system has WiFi Capabilities
	#6. Use ProtonMail and temporary mails for data transfer
	#7. Cross-Platform support
