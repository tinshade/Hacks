# Rename files in a directory
I needed my image files to be in numerically named and ordered for a JS project and it was pretty boring to do that manually so I made this python script to do the renaming for me.

The project I am refering to is also in my other repository which can be viewed here : https://github.com/tinshade/WebStuff/tree/Random-Image%2C-Random-Place
