# CHROME STEALER
This small script goes through the local DB used by chrome to store user data like usernames and passwords 
to websites that have auto-save for authentication fields. Most users like to hit save for convenience; this 
script exploits that nature of the victim to steal all stored data and mail it to the email ID in the mail module.
